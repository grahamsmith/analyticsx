# AnalyticsX Example

Example implementation of AnalyticsX in a flutter project

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates how AnalyticsX can be used in a Flutter project that requires events to be emitted to 
multiple analytics vendors. It includes a [Firebase implementation](lib/vendors/firebase.dart), shows another trivial 
[implementation 
of a 
vendor](lib/vendors/example_analytics_vendor.dart), 
and shows how to add [additional analytics actions](lib/events/simple_counter_event.dart) not provided OOTB by AnalyticsX.
