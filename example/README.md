# AnalyticsX Example

Example implementation of AnalyticsX in a flutter project

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates how AnalyticsX can be used in a Flutter project that requires events to be emitted to 
multiple analytics vendors. It includes a Firebase implementation, shows another trivial implementation of a vendor, 
and shows how to add additional analytics actions not provided OOTB by AnalyticsX.
